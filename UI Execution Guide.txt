The user interface of this system is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and consistent design across all modules. 
Every UI component is connected to the backend or Firebase through event-driven interaction.
When the user performs actions such as logging in, uploading images, selecting ZIP files, filtering doctors, or navigating between pages, the UI captures these events through JavaScript.
These actions trigger functions that either send data to the Flask backend (for predictions) or communicate with Firebase services (for authentication, storage, and health record management).
After the backend processes the prediction, the result page dynamically displays the output and automatically saves the prediction to Firebase Firestore.
The UI then updates the Health Records page by fetching the saved data from Firebase and rendering it in a structured table.
